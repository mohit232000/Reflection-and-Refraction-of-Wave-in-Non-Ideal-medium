Implemented a highly efficient implicit finite difference scheme for acoustic wave propagation based on the paper "A highly efficient implicit finite difference scheme for acoustic wave propagation" by Ajay Malkoti, Nimisha Vedanti, and Ram Krishna Tiwari. Utilized Python for implementation and successfully replicated the results of the paper. The proposed method uses fewer points to estimate derivatives than traditional central difference derivative operators. The coefficients on the left and right sides of the implicit scheme are calculated to the requisite precision based on the Taylor series expansion of the function at each point. The comparison between many characteristics of the implicit scheme and numerous CD schemes of various orders in the study demonstrates how effective, precise, and small the suggested technique is. While minimizing errors, it can significantly reduce the amount of computational resources. This scheme's use for seismic wave propagation in 2D and 3D acoustic mediums is illustrated in the study. In conclusion, this article makes a substantial addition to geophysics and offers helpful insights into creating numerical schemes for wave propagation.
